    The disabling of Offline Folders is strongly recommended to prevent Windows from caching network files on its local disk – a feature with no benefit to a diskless system

    Offline Files saves a copy of network files on the user's computer for use when the computer is not connected to the network.
    Note: Changes to this setting do not take effect until the affected computer is restarted.
